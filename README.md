# Continuous Delivery on the Kubernetes Plattform

## Welcome the microXchg 2017 in Berlin!

This repository contains all code related the session ["Continuous Delivery on the Kubernetes Plattform"](http://sched.co/93vH) by [Nicolas Byl](http://lanyrd.com/profile/nicolas.byl/). In this session we will provide a step-by-step demo how to build a continuous delivery pipeline running on [kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io).

## Lab 0: Prerequisites

To have this running on your machine, you will need the following tools:

* [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubectl/)
* [helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/releases)

You will also need a virtualization that is [supported by minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation). This tutorial has been tested on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
